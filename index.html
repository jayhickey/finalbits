    <h3 id="hi-im-jay">Hi, I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>I got my start by shipping apps independently just for fun. Since then I have led multiple successful teams at companies like Uber and Facebook, the most recent being the iOS team for Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses. As a founding engineer of the first Swift-based app at Facebook, I was the one responsible for the entire app experience from inception though launch, growing the team to 12 iOS developers along the way.</p>
    <p>I have the 0-to-1 experience that can help you get your MVP built. I have also worked on some of the largest, most complex apps in the App Store so I know what pitfalls to avoid if you are trying to grow and achieve scale. Check out <a href="https://jayhickey.com/resume">my resume</a> to read more about my background.</p>
    <p>As an expert in iOS and Apple platforms, I can provide extra support to you in an advisory role or on a contractual basis. Services include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Technical Expertise</strong> â€” I can set technical direction, architect best practices for your mobile team, or help you execute on whatever awesome features you are building next.</li>
    <li><strong>Product feedback</strong> â€” I can scope out product features and discuss tradeoffs to help you move faster. I will respond within 24 hours and get you feedback from my network or provide personal feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Hiring</strong> â€” I can conduct technical interviews to ensure you find the right engineers for your team.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> â€” I can provide technical mentorship to other engineers, helping them grow to take on larger roles and responsibilities at your company.</li>
    </ol>
